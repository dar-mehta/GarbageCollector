# GarbageCollector - RoboHacks
By Can Cui, Stephen Jia, Dar Mehta, Wesley Yue, and Nikhil Keswani

## Project Description
We built a small Rover-like robot that could patrol streets and collect litter. Additionally, it would be able to sort garbage and recycling appropriately.

A laptop would be mounted on the rover which ran a program that uses OpenCV to handle object detection. The laptop would communicate serially through a USB cable to an Arduino board which controlled the motors.

### Object Detection
The OpenCV Image Processing Library was used to detect objects on the ground.
